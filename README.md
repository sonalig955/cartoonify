# Cartoonify : A tool to generate cartoonize effect on your image.<br>

// ## Run main.py and upload your photos and hit enter to get the cartoonize effect on your image.</h1><br>

## Procedure and working
<h4>To convert an image to a cartoon, multiple transformations are done.<br> 
  Firstly, an image is converted to a Grayscale image. Yes, similar to the old dayâ€™s pictures!.<br>
  Then, the Grayscale image is smoothened, and program will extract the edges of the image.<br> 
  Finally, Program will combine all the generated image and highlight it's edges.<br>
  This creates a beautiful cartoon image with sharp and highlited edges and lightened color of the original image.</h4>
<br>  
<h3>For these Puspose, I have made an application using Tkinker GUI window and provided it a save button. So, that the cartoonized image must get saved at a particular folder.</h3>
